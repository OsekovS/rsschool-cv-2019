 My basic education is BMSTU "Radioelectronic complexes and systems". Almost all of my marks 5 and in university I become teachable.
 My education assumes understanding work of systems as a single entity. For example radar contain transmitting, receiving and
 antenna systems. It can be take placed on many objects (cars, vehicles, aircrafts, spacecrafts and even on humans body). 
 Digital part of radar is its brain. It realises special algorithms such as filtering, recognition, guidanse e.t.s. 
 All parts of this system must be carefully calculated. At university we learn many others radio systems. We also learned assembly,
 c++ and python programming languages. At uni I understood that now I live in post industrial society where software disign matters. 
 I want to learn web sites like complex systems and i started from frontend part.
 I worked three mounth in private company as electronic-engeneer and I understood that I want to work in team where senior worker cant 
 to offend workers for not competence
 I worked in state company two year as electronic-engeneer and I understood that I want to work company in which I can learn many
 new things and tecnologies and also I like work teams where are many interesting people who committed to the development. 
 To sum up I need interesting and kind team where It will be interesting to solve any tasks:)
