      Digital part of radar is its brain. It realises special algorithms such as filtering, recognition, guidanse e.t.s. 
      All parts of this system must be carefully calculated. At university we learn many others radio systems. We also learned assembly,
      c++ and python programming languages. At uni I understood that now I live in post industrial society where software disign          matters.
